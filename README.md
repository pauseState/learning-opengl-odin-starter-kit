# Learn OpenGL - Odin Starter Kit

A small template to get started on https://learnopengl.com when using [Odin](https://odin-lang.org).

The included code sets up a window, sets the correct OpenGL core profile to v3.3, and renders in a loop with a color buffer clear. Everything to jump right in and start rendering triangles.

Run with `odin run .` when inside the directory with the starter file.
